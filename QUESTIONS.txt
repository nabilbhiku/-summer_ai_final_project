Nicola, Nabil, Val and Luke

Introduction. What is the problem or task you are trying to solve? 
-We created an AI that can play tic tac toe optimally.

What methods are you using to solve them? (This may be answered by the assignment itself, but write it in your own words.)
-We used minimax, alpha beta cutoff and alpha beta pruning

What implementation choices did you make? How did you decide on those choices? How did you evaluate or test your system?
-We first made UML diagrams, pseudocodes and then implemented minimax, alpha beta cutoff and alpha beta pruning through coding.

Did your system work? How well? Provide tables / numerical results if appropriate.
-Yes it worked with tic tac toewith minimax and alpha beta pruning but not as well with alpha beta cutoff.

Based on your results, were your methods and choices appropriate for the task? What would you do differently next time? 
Or if you had more time? Are there any ethical implications of your system that others should be aware of?
-Yes our methods were appropriate. Next time we would write our own code for tic tac toe because it was challenging to understand what the built in functions did.
